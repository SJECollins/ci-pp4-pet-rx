            <p>PetR<sub>x</sub> takes away the tedious job of calculating dosages. Once your practice's preferred dosage
                for a medication is set and animal's weight is registered, all you need to do is go to a patient's file,
                select "Add Prescription" and select the drug you wish to prescribe. PetR<sub>x</sub> handles the
                calculation for you.</p>
            <p>PetR<sub>x</sub> saves all prescriptions to a patient's file for easy review. And every prescription you
                create will be saved to your own profile for you to review whenever you need.</p>

            <p>As all the calculations are done by PetR<sub>x</sub>, you can be sure that all your staff are following
                your practice's drug dosing protocols.</p>
            <p>With all prescriptions saved to an animal's profile, you can quickly review their medication history for
                any irregularities.</p>

            <p>Prevent human error in medication dosages by setting your practice's dosing protocols as you add a drug
                to the database.</p>
            <p>Record every prescription on an animal's record as it is calculated so that reviewing their prescription
                history is quick and easy, and you can spot any irregularities.</p>
            <p>Include relevant warnings specific to your practice for each drug, which your staff can review in the
                detailed drug view.</p>
